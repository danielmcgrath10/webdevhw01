I was sort of stuck on the nginx config file setup, but had an 
epiphany class 
that 
allowed me to understand. I ended up realizing that the individual 
config files 
are being used as sort of a subdomain routing rather than url path 
routing as 
sort of different sites.

I also got a little slowed down by gandi not updating their DNS 
records as 
quickly as I might have liked.
